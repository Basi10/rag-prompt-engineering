# Precision RAG System

## Introduction

​​PromptlyTech is a company that wants to build on RAG technology and address the issue of precision in prompts, ensuring customers get the best out of the RAG system, significantly reduceing the time for companies to craft good prompts in making use of LLMs.

## Objective

The aim of the project is to combine RAG and prompt engineering, ensuring users have the capability to generate multiple high quality prompts that ensure best possible results from the given dataset. We also allow users to enter their own prompt and evaluate the effectiveness of the prompt against the provided dataset.

## Usage

###

Both the front-end and the back-end have to be started.
